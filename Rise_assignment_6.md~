# Metadata for *Evelina* (Exercise 6)

Writeup due to Known before class Monday, November 2nd, 2015

Estimated time: 1-2 hours

The two major In exercise 5, we examined some bibliographic metadata in both printed bibliographies and ECCO, and we visually examined digital facsimiles of eighteenth-century novels and also used the ARTEMIS tools to analyze and explore the OCR'd text of those facsimiles and the metadata attached to them. (Metadata, you will remember, is just "data about data"; bibliographic metadata is data about books, for example the electronic catalog records that accompanied the ECCO facsimiles. The metadata of a Word or PDF document usually contains information about the author, the program used, the time and date of composition, etc.)

Now are going to look in more depth at two elements: metadata (in this exercise) and full texts (in exercise 7). We will play with some metadata and practice modeling a collection of novels to see what more we can learn about early fiction in English using these methods before turning to experiment with how we might ask research questions that join metadata with full-text analysis (in exercise 8).

All together, these three views of a corpus or collection of eighteenth-century novels will help us learn more about what new novels were like during the eighteenth century, and especially during the years leading up to and after the publication of *Evelina* (1778).

### Look at the metadata.

First, open the file ???   spreadsheet program (Excel or similar). Look at it; you will see that each line is a set of information about a give novel, and each column represents one value. Note that your spreadsheet program is already a type of data visualization, though a very general and not especially useful one. What we need is a way to easily select one or a few of the columns and visualize their values for us.

### Google Fusion Tables

We will do this using Google Fusion tables, which is a relatively simple way to take a spreadsheet of information and create some visualizations from it. Go to www.google.com/fusiontables, sign in with your Google account (create one if you don't have one), and upload
