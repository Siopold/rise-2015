# Metadata + Topic Modeling (Exercise 8)

+ Writeup due to Known before class Wednesday, December 2nd, 2015
+ Estimated time: 1-2 hours

This *final assignment* of the computationally-assisted text analysis series asks you to speculate on how you might combine metadata and topic modeling to ask a research question about a group of eighteenth-century novels. In a paragraph or two, frame a research question and describe how you might go about answering it. Draw on some concern that has occupied us over the course of the semester, get inspired by some aspect of one of the critical and theoretical readings, or strike off in an entirely new direction.
