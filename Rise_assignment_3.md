# Indexing *Pamela* (Exercise 3)

While we have read a good long chunk of *Pamela*, we don't have time to read all of the first two volumes, let alone to read volumes 3 and 4 about Pamela's life in (*spoiler alert*) "Her Exalted Condition." We need a shortcut - some plot summaries, maybe an index of the high points and important parts of the novel. Even the part we read can be difficult to remember in the detail we might need for a particular purpose - paper writing, for example, or impressing new acquaintances at cocktails parties with apposite Richardson quotations. (Note: don't actually try that second one.)

Eighteenth-century readers possessed a number of forms and technologies for solving this problem. In the 1742 octavo edition of all four volumes of *Pamela*, Richardson included a detailed table of contents. It had uses for different kinds of readers and non-readers of that novel. It would "serve to revive the Memory of the principle Matters in the Minds of those who have read them";  it gives "an easy and clear View" of the novels' contents to those who have not read them "nor perhaps have Leisure to peruse them" (note the reference to the politics of leisure and work as discussed in class).  At the same time, Richardson explained, the table of contents functions as "a copious INDEX to direct the Reader where to find the most material passages."

In this exercise, we will take a look at Richardson's index to *Pamela* and construct some new (and more temporary) indexes (indices?) of our own.

### Richardson's Index to *Pamela*

First, take a look at the [1742 Table of Contents](https://github.com/rbuurma/rise-2015/blob/master/Pamela_1742_Table_of_Contents.pdf). What kind of information about the novels (*Pamela* and *Pamela in Her Exalted Condition*) does it offer you? How is it organized? What is the narrative voice like? What kinds of words are repeated, what kinds of events are described? Does this information point towards any new interpretations of *Pamela*, large or small?

### Machine-Indexing *Pamela*

The second part of of this exercise ask you to use the collection of text analysis tools in Voyant to make your own indexes to *Pamela*.

Try to set aside a few hours for this assignment. You want to give yourself permission mess around with Voyant in an open-ended, non-goal-oriented way while still making sure you find something interesting to write about.

#### Step 1

Go to http://voyant-tools.org/ and upload the clean copy of *Pamela* you can find on Github and in our Dropbox. When you have uploaded, press "reveal" and a new window will open. Note that the upper-righthand icon disk icon will give you a url that will save this state of Voyant for you to return to. (Note that the plain-text copy of *Pamela* we are using is drawn from [this](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/6124/pg6124.txt) Project Gutenberg text. Take a quick look at it - what edition does it seem to be based on? We will tackle questions to do with text preparation and cleaning in a future assignment, but it's worth giving them a thought now.)

#### Step 2

Look first at the “word cloud” generated by Voyant (in the upper-left hand corner of the screen). This gives you a visual representation of word frequency - larger words are used more often. Maximize the word cloud window using the small window icon in the upper-lefthand part of the word cloud window, and look at the visualization of frequent words. (Note also that you can use the tiny screen icon to maximize each individual window in Voyant.)

Do some of them seem interesting? Make a note of which.

Do many of them seem not that interesting? Click on the small gear icon, choose the English (Taporware) list of stopwords, and apply them. Refresh the word cloud. What do you see now? What did the stop word list do? Are there still some words you would like to remove to make room for potentially more interesting words? Click the gear again, choose "edit stopwords", add some words that you would like to remove, and save your list. What do you see now? (Note: we will talk more about the poetics and practices of stop word lists in the future, but it is worth giving them a thought now.) Note that if you select "apply stop words globally" they will apply to all of the windows; if not they will apply only to the window in which you are working.

#### Step 3

For another way to explore word use in the novel, turn to the “corpus” section of the text and find a section of *Pamela* that is interesting to you. Notice that when you float over the words it tells you the frequency with which the word is used. When you click on these words, you’ll see on the right that you can jump to the various places in the novel where the word is used. Think about how Richardson uses one or two example words of your choice in other places. Does he use the word in the same way? Differently?

#### Step 4

Glance through the list of words in the bottom-left hand corner of the screen—this is a list of words ranked by the number of times they are used in *Pamela*.  Do you recognize any patterns in these words? Are there any commonly used words that are surprising to you? Anything you would expect to be there that is missing?

Try selecting a word, and see its frequency over time appear in the upper-right-hand "word trends" window. Play around until you figure out how to compare multiple words; then try to come up with some interesting single words and interesting comparisons.

For example, if I use the "search" box in the "words in the corpus" window to search for the word "know," it will find "know", "knows", "known", and "knowning" (also "acknowledge" and "knowledge"), and will graph their frequency over the duration of the text (arbitrarily split into ten segments) in the "word trends" window. I can choose the "collapse terms" box to see a unified trendline for the four words. (I can also click the heart icon to add those words to my favorites for later.) Then I try to think of a word or words I want to graph against "know" - "feel" suggests itself to me, but I find no occurrences! I set this negative finding aside to investigate later, and move on to compare some more trends.

Note especially that the "word trends" screen is not very useful in the small window; to use it you will have to toggle back and forth between the Voyant dashboard and the maximized word trends screen to use it effectively.

*Consider taking some screen shots to illustrate your write-up.*

#### Step 5

Challenge: Think about one of the core arguments Nancy Armstrong makes in the selections from *Desire and Domestic Fiction* we read this week. Is there any way you might - provisionally and partially - use the Voyant tools to extend, press against, or create new evidence for one of these claims? Choose a specific claim or your version of a specific claim, and then think about how you might translate that claim to the level of a word or a collection of words.

And here is the Voyant documentation to help; it includes tutorials. I also recommend that you spend a little time playing around with voyant. Here is a list of other tools that you can use through Voyant.


### Write

Write a paragraph or two on some particularly interesting and suggestive findings from your work in steps 2-5 - the more specific the better. Positive or negative results can be good  findings. Feel free also to share any thoughts about the value and/or difficulty of this type of lightweight text analysis work.  Post to Known with #Exercise3 #Voyant #TextAnalysis and any other relevant tags.

### More (optional and for the future)

Voyant just scratches the surface; two more good sources for collections of text analysis platforms and recipes are Alan Liu's [DH Toychest](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244319/Digital%20Humanities%20Tools#tools-text-analysis) and [Tapor2](http://www.tapor.ca/) - both are large collections of tools for finding, processing, and visualizing texts of different kinds.

The new (and experimental) [XSEDE](http://ec2-54-85-108-97.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3838/tag/) collection of tools is also interesting; the "data" tab lets you walk through the process of preparing your uploaded text for analysis in a way that teaches you a bit about text preparation. The "explore" tab lets you look at some characteristics of the words in your document, and "transform" offers quick versions of some topic modeling algorithms we will explore in more detail later in the semester.

This is the first iteration of this assignment; if you run into bugs or other difficulties, please let me know.
