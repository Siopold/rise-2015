## Rise of the Novel Descriptive Bibliography Project Upload Instructions

ADD EXPLANATION OF OMEKA HERE

### Getting Started

Omeka is a free, open-source content management system and web-publishing platform or CMS which is used to create and display collections and exhibitions of library, archival, museum, and scholarly materials.

In Omeka, a "collection" is made up of individual "items." For the purposes of the Rise of the Novel, each of us will create a separate "collection" for our assigned novel. Each collection will be made up of the following Item Types:

+ Traditional Description - This is an HTML rendering of your traditional bibliographic description.
+ Experimental Description - This is where you will post your experimental description. It can include text, photo images of your description, videos, and/or audio clips.
+ Commentary - Your commentary item contains two elements: 1) Your clear, considered sentence or two of explanation of how your experimental bibliography works to describe something about your novel that your traditional bibliography can't capture. This goes on the front page of your display, so you want it to be short, clear, and intriguing! 2) Your longer paragraph or two explanation. The reader needs to click through to get here.
+ Collection Thumbnail - An image - something you create, find, or crop from a section of an image of your description. It will generate the Thumbnail that represents your project on the front page of the site.

Before adding any content to the Rise of the Novel site, you’ll need to log in here with the account information you have been sent: http://riseofthenovel.swarthmore.edu/admin

You should have already received an email inviting you to activate your new account.

### Creating Your New Collection

From the Omeka Dashboard, you will notice a menu on the left side of the screen. Click the Collections menu item.
A new screen will load, revealing each of the collections already added to the site. At the very top there will be a green button labeled, Add a Collection. Click this button.

This will load the Dublin Core edit screen for your new collection. At a minimum, you must complete the following fields:

+ Title - use the short title of the novel you are describing as the title of your collection.
+ Creator (original author of the Novel. If unknown, use: Anonymous)
+ Date (semester the project was created. example format: Fall 2012)
+ Contributor (the name of the student who created project)

When you’ve finished adding the available metadata click the green button labeled, Add Collection. You now have a new, empty collection to which you will add items: your tradition description, your experimental description, your commentary (including a shorter and a longer version) and a thumbnail (which will represent you project on the front page of the site).

###Adding Items to Your Collection: Traditional Description

1. From the Omeka Dashboard, you will notice a menu on the left side of the screen. Click the Items menu item. A new screen will load, revealing each of the items already added to the site by others. At the very top there will be a green button labeled, Add an Item. Click this button. This should bring you to your item screen under the Dublin Core tab for your new Traditional Description item. At a minimum, you must complete these fields of Dublin Core Metadata:

+ Title - use "Lastname Traditional"
+ Creator (Use the original author of your novel. If unknown, use "Anonymous.")
+ Date (The semester the project was created. Example format: Fall 2015)
+ Contributor (Your full name.)

2. Now add the item to your collection. To do this, look towards the top right of the page to find a dropdown menu labeled Collection. Choose your previously created collection. Note that because it is the name of your novel, it may be the same as a few other existing collections. In this case, your newly-created collection should be be the furthest down on the list.

3. Check the "public" box you will see here as well.

4. Now you need to choose your Item Type. From the tabs at the top of the screen, choose Item Type Metadata. From the Dropdown menu, select Traditional Description.

5. A text box will appear, along with a checkbox labeled Use HTML. Check the box.

6. The text box is where you will put your formatted traditional descriptive bibliography. Before you paste it in, you must convert your Markdown formatting to HTML. The easiest way:

+ Go to http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus
+ Paste your Markdown-formatted traditional description into the top box. Select "Source + Preview"  under the "Results" dropdown and click "Convert."
+ In the "HTML source" box of the Dingus, you will see your description in HTML formatting. (At the bottom you will see a preview of how your new HTML will render on a web page.) Copy it.
+ Return to the Omeka site and paste your new HTML into the Omeka text box in the Traditional Description item.

7. Save your new Traditional Description Item by clicking the green button labeled Add Item. If you want to return to the Item (or any other Item you create) you can alway click on the Item and selected "Edit."

### Adding Items to Your Collection: Experimental Description

Begin as in adding your Traditional Description, but in step 4 select Experimental Description as your Item Type.

Now follow instructions below which best describe your Experimental Description:

For a Text-based Experimental Description:

+ Simply paste your Experimental Description into the field labeled Text.
+ If you’d like more control over the formatting of the text, check the box below the Text field labeled Use HTML.
+ Save your new Experimental Description Item by clicking the green button labeled Add Item.

For an Image-based Experimental Description:

+ If your experimental description is an image, be sure to fill out the Image Alt Text field as well as any other applicable fields (Original Format, Physical Dimensions).
+ From the top of the page, select the tab item for Files.
+ Click the button labeled Choose File.
+ Select the appropriate file from your computer.
+ Save your new Experimental Description Item by clicking the green button labeled Add Item.
+ If you intend to create an image slideshow or gallery create a new Experimental Description Item for each image.

For an video- or audio-based Experimental Description:

+ From the top of the page, select the tab item for Files.
+ Click the button labeled Choose File.
+ Select the appropriate file from your computer.
+ Save your new Experimental Description Item by clicking the green button labeled Add Item.

### Adding Items to Your Collection: Adding Commentary

Begin as in adding your Traditional Description, but in step 4 select Commentary as your Item Type.

In the "Text" box, add your paragraph or two explanation of how your experimental bibliography works to describe something about your novel that your traditional bibliography can't capture.

In the "Text Excerpt" box, ignore the instructions: this isn't necessarily an excerpt from your text. Instead, it is your clear, short sentence or two of explanation of how your experimental bibliography works to describe something about your novel that your traditional bibliography can't capture. This will appear at the top of the main public display of your project. By clicking on the "more" button, readers will then be able to access your longer text.

### Adding Items to Your Collection:  Collection Thumbnail

+ Create a Collection Thumbnail image.
	+ This is the image that will represent your project on the front page of the website; you may want to look at the website to think about how it will look: http://riseofthenovel.swarthmore.edu/.
	+ Using photo editing software, select an image that you can crop as a square a 1x1 ratio). You might crop a square out of an image from your experimental project, or you might find a image elsewhere that does a good job of representing your project. (Note that if you find an image on the internet, you must make sure that you are free to use it and provide the source url and any other relevant information in the Dublin metadata fields.)
	+ One way to do this is to use iPhoto if you have a Mac to use. Make a new copy of the image you want to use. Open the it in iPhoto, select the "edit" option, click "crop," and select "square." Then make sure you save the edited image with a new name.
	+ Another way to do this is to use Picasa. Download Picasa. Make a new copy of the image you want to use. Import it into Picasa and select the photo by double-clicking. On the left, you will see a editing bar. Select the tab with the wrench, and use the "crop" function with the 1x1 ratio dropdown to select and crop the square you want. Then make sure you save the edited image with a new name.
+ Back in Omeka, begin to create a new Item as in adding your Traditional Description, but in step 4 select Collection Thumbnail as your Item Type.
+ From the top of the page, select the tab item for Files.
+ Click the button labeled Choose File.
+ Select the appropriate file from your computer.
+ Save your new Collection Thumbnail Item by clicking the green button labeled Add Item.
