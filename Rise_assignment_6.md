# Metadata for *Evelina* (Exercise 6)

Writeup due to Known before class Monday, November 2nd, 2015
Estimated time: 1-2 hours

The two major In exercise 5, we examined some bibliographic metadata in both printed bibliographies and ECCO, and we visually examined digital facsimiles of eighteenth-century novels and also used the ARTEMIS tools to analyze and explore the OCR'd text of those facsimiles and the metadata attached to them. (Metadata, you will remember, is just "data about data"; bibliographic metadata is data about books, for example the electronic catalog records that accompanied the ECCO facsimiles. The metadata of a Word or PDF document usually contains information about the author, the program used, the time and date of composition, etc.)

Now are going to look in more depth at two elements: metadata (in this exercise) and full texts (in exercise 7). We will play with some metadata and practice modeling a collection of novels to see what more we can learn about early fiction in English using these methods before turning to experiment with how we might ask research questions that join metadata with full-text analysis (in exercise 8).

### Step 1: Look at the metadata.

You have a tsv (tab separated values) file of selected metadata on about 1500 novels published between 1660 and 1830. This hybrid metadata began its life in a library card catalog record, and was then exported and enriched with additional information by students working for the [Early Novels Database project](earlynovels.org). This data was made by people and has been selected and pull from an in-progress dataset; there will be errors! (If you are interested in looking at a cleaner but less interesting set of metadata records for eighteenth-century novels that exist in full-text digitized

First, open the file with a spreadsheet program (Excel or similar). Look at it; you will see that each line is a set of metadata about an individual novel, and each column represents a value or metadata field. Note that your spreadsheet program is already a type of data visualization, though a very general and not especially useful one for our current goal of exploring this . What we need is a way to easily select one or a few of the columns and visualize their values for us.

### Google Fusion Tables

We will do this using Google Fusion tables, which is a relatively simple way to take a spreadsheet of information and create some visualizations from it. Go to www.google.com/fusiontables, sign in with your Google account (create one if you don't have one), and find and upload [exercise6ENDmetadata.tsv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Mu9KZ7cXx7fDBoazXEmVM_5ve-Br2mcEP17RenHARE/edit?usp=sharing) You can also find the metadata in a tsv file on our github.

After you have created your table, you will see some tabs. In the first tab, you will find a spreadsheet.

Explore the data in the cards. Use this doc to learn what the data means and how it was created. Add END blurb.

Make a map if you want (change column type)
